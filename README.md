# Time-Series-Forecasting

The notebook is the implementation of the study of time series forecasting.
The monthly sales of the champagne sales is used as the dataset and the future sales of the champagne is predicted.

The general process for model is as follows:

•	Visualize the Time Series Data

•	Convert non-stationary data to stationary data

•	Plot the Correlation and AutoCorrelation Charts

•	Construct the ARIMA Model or Seasonal ARIMA based on the data. Dickey Fuller test is implemented 

•	The model is used to make predictions
